# Rebasing Challenge

Your task as a team is to use what we learned in the demonstrations to prepare a local branch for a pull request. The result of the pull request should be a <b><i>single commit message</i></b> summarizing the new feature implemented (we're looking for a summary of the changes here).

* There should be <b>no duplicate commits</b> in the main branch's commit history in the GitHub repo
* The main branch's history should be intact.

### Setup
1. Each group will create a new repo on GitHub (include a README.md for easy cloning)
2. Create an HTML Boilerplate with "!"
3. The members that created the repos will push the boilerplate to update the remote
4. The other members will clone the remote repo and create a local feature branch from the "remote main"
5. Each member is to make at least 3 commits with changes in their respective branch
   - Groups of 2 will have a main branch and a single feature branch
   - Groups of 3 will have a main branch and two feature branches
